## ðŸš€&nbsp;&nbsp;Usage


### How to Get Started
- First, download watershed.zip from the [release page](https://github.com/xiejx5/watershed_delineation/releases)
- Next, unzip and open watershed.exe, clip start to execute an example
<br>


### Inputs
1. Flow direction: a file path or a folder path of tiff (see [example_flowdir.tif](example_flowdir.tif) for example)
2. The given coordinates of watershed outlets: a excel sheet contains longitudes and latitudes in the WGS84 projection. Watershed area is optional as auxiliary information to improve the delineation accuracy (see [example_station.xlsx](example_station.xlsx) for example)
<br>


### Outputs
1. Shapefile: watershed boundaries stored as vector data
2. Info.xlsx: delineated watershed areas, containing areas of confluence, mainstream, and tributray relocations.
3. Map.html: a visual map of watershed boundaries with satellite images as the background

## âš¡&nbsp;&nbsp;Best Practices

<details>
<summary><b>Divide [HydroSHES] or [MERIT] Hydro flow direction into several parts to reduce memorary usage</b></summary>

Use miniconda for your python environments (it's usually unnecessary to install full anaconda environment, miniconda should be enough).
It makes it easier to install some dependencies, like cudatoolkit for GPU support.<br>
Example installation:
```yaml
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
Create environment using bash script provided in the template:
```yaml
bash bash/setup_conda.sh
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Use automatic code formatting</b></summary>

Use pre-commit hooks to standardize code formatting of your project and save mental energy.<br>
Simply install pre-commit package with:
```yaml
pip install pre-commit
```
Next, install hooks from [.pre-commit-config.yaml](.pre-commit-config.yaml):
```yaml
pre-commit install
```
After that your code will be automatically reformatted on every new commit.<br>
Currently template contains configurations of **black** (python code formatting), **isort** (python import sorting), **flake8** (python code analysis) and **prettier** (yaml formating). <br>

To reformat all files in the project use command:
```yaml
pre-commit run -a
```
